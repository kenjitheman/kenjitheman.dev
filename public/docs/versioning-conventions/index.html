<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document outlines the versioning conventions adopted by the Software Engineering and Development Club at the State University of Information and Communication Technologies. These conventions are based on the standard versioning practices in the Rust programming language. Semantic Versioning 2.0.0</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the world of software management there exists a dreaded place called
&ldquo;dependency hell.&rdquo; The bigger your system grows and the more packages you
integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one
day, in this pit of despair.</p>
<p>In systems with many dependencies, releasing new package versions can quickly
become a nightmare. If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in
danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to
release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are
specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity
(assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable).
Dependency hell is where you are when version lock and/or version promiscuity
prevent you from easily and safely moving your project forward.</p>
<p>As a solution to this problem, was proposed a simple set of rules and
requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.
These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing
widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software.
For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This may
consist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it is
important that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your public
API, you communicate changes to it with specific increments to your version
number. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not
affecting the API increment the patch version, backward compatible API
additions/changes increment the minor version, and backward incompatible API
changes increment the major version.</p>
<p>This set of rules was called &ldquo;Semantic Versioning.&rdquo; Under this scheme, version numbers
and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has
been modified from one version to the next.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-versioning-specification-semver">Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)</h2>
<p>The key words &ldquo;MUST&rdquo;, &ldquo;MUST NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;REQUIRED&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHOULD&rdquo;,
&ldquo;SHOULD NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;RECOMMENDED&rdquo;, &ldquo;MAY&rdquo;, and &ldquo;OPTIONAL&rdquo; in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API. This API
could be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in documentation.
However it is done, it SHOULD be precise and comprehensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are
non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the
major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version.
Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -&gt; 1.10.0 -&gt; 1.11.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change
at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number
is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it
changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if only backward
compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal
change that fixes incorrect behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if new, backward
compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be
incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be
incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced
within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version
MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major version X (X.y.z | X &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if any backward
incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY also include minor
and patch level changes. Patch and minor versions MUST be reset to 0 when major
version is incremented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a
series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch
version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens
[0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST
NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower
precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version
indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the
intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated
normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7,
1.0.0-x.7.z.92, 1.0.0-x-y-z.--.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot
separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version.
Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-].
Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining
version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata,
have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700,
1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85, 1.0.0+21AF26D3----117B344092BD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major,
minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata
does not figure into precedence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of
these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch
versions are always compared numerically.</p>
<p>Example: 1.0.0 &lt; 2.0.0 &lt; 2.1.0 &lt; 2.1.1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower
precedence than a normal version:</p>
<p>Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and
patch version MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier
from left to right until a difference is found as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII
sort order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric
identifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a
smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.1 &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.beta &lt; 1.0.0-beta &lt;
1.0.0-beta.2 &lt; 1.0.0-beta.11 &lt; 1.0.0-rc.1 &lt; 1.0.0.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not a new or revolutionary idea. In fact, you probably do something
close to this already. The problem is that &ldquo;close&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t good enough. Without
compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are
essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear
definition to the above ideas, it becomes easy to communicate your intentions
to the users of your software. Once these intentions are clear, flexible (but
not too flexible) dependency specifications can finally be made.</p>
<p>A simple example will demonstrate how Semantic Versioning can make dependency
hell a thing of the past. Consider a library called &ldquo;Firetruck.&rdquo; It requires a
Semantically Versioned package named &ldquo;Ladder.&rdquo; At the time that Firetruck is
created, Ladder is at version 3.1.0. Since Firetruck uses some functionality
that was first introduced in 3.1.0, you can safely specify the Ladder
dependency as greater than or equal to 3.1.0 but less than 4.0.0. Now, when
Ladder version 3.1.1 and 3.2.0 become available, you can release them to your
package management system and know that they will be compatible with existing
dependent software.</p>
<p>As a responsible developer you will, of course, want to verify that any
package upgrades function as advertised. The real world is a messy place;
there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about that but be vigilant. What you can do is let
Semantic Versioning provide you with a sane way to release and upgrade
packages without having to roll new versions of dependent packages, saving you
time and hassle.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds desirable, all you need to do to start using Semantic
Versioning is to declare that you are doing so and then follow the rules. Link
to this website from your README so others know the rules and can benefit from
them.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="how-should-i-deal-with-revisions-in-the-0yz-initial-development-phase">How should I deal with revisions in the 0.y.z initial development phase?</h3>
<p>The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1.0
and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-know-when-to-release-100">How do I know when to release 1.0.0?</h3>
<p>If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be
1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should
be 1.0.0. If you&rsquo;re worrying a lot about backward compatibility, you should
probably already be 1.0.0.</p>
<h3 id="doesnt-this-discourage-rapid-development-and-fast-iteration">Doesn&rsquo;t this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?</h3>
<p>Major version zero is all about rapid development. If you&rsquo;re changing the API
every day you should either still be in version 0.y.z or on a separate
development branch working on the next major version.</p>
<h3 id="if-even-the-tiniest-backward-incompatible-changes-to-the-public-api-require-a-major-version-bump-wont-i-end-up-at-version-4200-very-rapidly">If even the tiniest backward incompatible changes to the public API require a major version bump, won&rsquo;t I end up at version 42.0.0 very rapidly?</h3>
<p>This is a question of responsible development and foresight. Incompatible
changes should not be introduced lightly to software that has a lot of
dependent code. The cost that must be incurred to upgrade can be significant.
Having to bump major versions to release incompatible changes means you&rsquo;ll
think through the impact of your changes, and evaluate the cost/benefit ratio
involved.</p>
<h3 id="documenting-the-entire-public-api-is-too-much-work">Documenting the entire public API is too much work!</h3>
<p>It is your responsibility as a professional developer to properly document
software that is intended for use by others. Managing software complexity is a
hugely important part of keeping a project efficient, and that&rsquo;s hard to do if
nobody knows how to use your software, or what methods are safe to call. In
the long run, Semantic Versioning, and the insistence on a well defined public
API can keep everyone and everything running smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-do-if-i-accidentally-release-a-backward-incompatible-change-as-a-minor-version">What do I do if I accidentally release a backward incompatible change as a minor version?</h3>
<p>As soon as you realize that you&rsquo;ve broken the Semantic Versioning spec, fix
the problem and release a new minor version that corrects the problem and
restores backward compatibility. Even under this circumstance, it is
unacceptable to modify versioned releases. If it&rsquo;s appropriate,
document the offending version and inform your users of the problem so that
they are aware of the offending version.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-i-do-if-i-update-my-own-dependencies-without-changing-the-public-api">What should I do if I update my own dependencies without changing the public API?</h3>
<p>That would be considered compatible since it does not affect the public API.
Software that explicitly depends on the same dependencies as your package
should have their own dependency specifications and the author will notice any
conflicts. Determining whether the change is a patch level or minor level
modification depends on whether you updated your dependencies in order to fix
a bug or introduce new functionality. We would usually expect additional code
for the latter instance, in which case it&rsquo;s obviously a minor level increment.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-i-inadvertently-alter-the-public-api-in-a-way-that-is-not-compliant-with-the-version-number-change-ie-the-code-incorrectly-introduces-a-major-breaking-change-in-a-patch-release">What if I inadvertently alter the public API in a way that is not compliant with the version number change (i.e. the code incorrectly introduces a major breaking change in a patch release)?</h3>
<p>Use your best judgment. If you have a huge audience that will be drastically
impacted by changing the behavior back to what the public API intended, then
it may be best to perform a major version release, even though the fix could
strictly be considered a patch release. Remember, Semantic Versioning is all
about conveying meaning by how the version number changes. If these changes
are important to your users, use the version number to inform them.</p>
<h3 id="how-should-i-handle-deprecating-functionality">How should I handle deprecating functionality?</h3>
<p>Deprecating existing functionality is a normal part of software development and
is often required to make forward progress. When you deprecate part of your
public API, you should do two things: (1) update your documentation to let
users know about the change, (2) issue a new minor release with the deprecation
in place. Before you completely remove the functionality in a new major release
there should be at least one minor release that contains the deprecation so
that users can smoothly transition to the new API.</p>
<h3 id="does-semver-have-a-size-limit-on-the-version-string">Does SemVer have a size limit on the version string?</h3>
<p>No, but use good judgment. A 255 character version string is probably overkill,
for example. Also, specific systems may impose their own limits on the size of
the string.</p>
<h3 id="is-v123-a-semantic-version">Is &ldquo;v1.2.3&rdquo; a semantic version?</h3>
<p>No, &ldquo;v1.2.3&rdquo; is not a semantic version. However, prefixing a semantic version
with a &ldquo;v&rdquo; is a common way (in English) to indicate it is a version number.
Abbreviating &ldquo;version&rdquo; as &ldquo;v&rdquo; is often seen with version control. Example:
<code>git tag v1.2.3 -m &quot;Release version 1.2.3&quot;</code>, in which case &ldquo;v1.2.3&rdquo; is a tag
name and the semantic version is &ldquo;1.2.3&rdquo;.</p>
