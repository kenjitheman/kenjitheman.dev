Hey there! I’m just a guy, a tech enthusiast on a quest to elevate my developer workflow, build high-performance projects, explore the intricacies of memory, and craft remarkable software.

I at least try to live by the philosophy of “Do what you love, love what you do.” I’m passionate about technology, and I’m always eager to learn and grow. I’m a software engineer, and I’m constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge. I’m a big fan of open-source software and the Linux ecosystem. I’m also a huge fan of the Rust programming language and the Go programming language. I’m always looking for ways to improve my workflow and make my life easier.

Love my neovim (btw) setup on Arch Linux (btw), and I’m always tweaking my dotfiles to make them perfect for both performance and aesthetics. My days are filled with the rhythm of lines of code, debugging sessions, and the satisfaction of solving problems. I approach technology with passion, finding joy and fun in every aspect.

I’m always looking for new challenges and new ways to improve myself and continue this endless cycle of self-improvement.
